Multi-Agent-Pacman
===========

This is my CS188 Project 1.

In this project, I have designed agents for the classic version of Pacman, including ghosts. Along the way, I have implemented both minimax and expectimax search and try your hand at evaluation function design. 
For more information about the project please refer <a href=https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/sp12/projects/multiagent/multiagentProject.html>here</a> to the CS188 official website.
